    "# **Answers**\n",
    "1. The follow three things reall stuck out to me as I listened to the podcast.\n",
    "* I learned what Kaggle is. I've not ever had any experience with that particular competition. I clicked around on the site and saw some pretty interesting competitions and data sets that would be fun to use with my Coding Club students.\n",
    "* I learned that my original exposure to CS in college was not unique. I also had to take a few CS courses to round out my Math degree (which I didn't finish, I just a got a degree in Physics with a minor in Math, but that's a separate story) and I found them pretty abstract and not interesting. It wasn't until I started teaching CS to high school students that I really fell in love with CS, especially the programming side.\n",
    "* I learned that freelance work is still very big and a great way to get started. That is definitely something I'll take back to my students, and I hope to work with some of my more advanced students in helping them start to build out their portfolios in high school.\n",
    "2. My overall reaction to the podcast was positive. It was nice to know that a top-down approach can help in capturing a students' interest. I certainly like the idea of learning just enough to get started and then digging into the details as needed. That's the approach that I take with my own students, and it's been very successful. However, I feel like there was maybe a bit too much bashing of the bottom-up approach. At some point, rubber meets the road and students have to understand some of the details. It's very easy when taking a top-down approach to skip some of the finer points, and that can come back and bite you. I would say that a mix of bottom-up and top-down approaches is necessary to really give students a firm foundation in CS.\n",
    "3. I am not any more or less interested in a career in Data Science. As I stated in my Semester Goals, I am a high school teacher and I'm not looking for a career change. What I'm looking for are things to take back that I can expose my students to and maybe spark their interest, or tools that I can use to be a more effective teacher.\n"
